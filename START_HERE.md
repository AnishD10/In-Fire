## 🎯 The System in 30 Seconds

### What It Does
**Real-time gas leakage detection with email alerts**

```
ESP32 reads gas → MQTT to cloud → Backend processes
↓
Check threshold → If dangerous, send email alert
↓
Frontend shows real-time data → User can control system
↓
User sees dashboard → Gets alerts → Controls via buttons
```

### Key Features
- ✅ Real-time gas monitoring (every 2 seconds)
- ✅ Automatic email alerts when danger detected
- ✅ Beautiful responsive dashboard
- ✅ System control buttons (ON/OFF/TEST)
- ✅ Email subscription management
- ✅ Production-ready code

### Technologies
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MQTT, Nodemailer
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Device**: ESP32, MicroPython
- **Cloud**: HiveMQ MQTT, Gmail SMTP
